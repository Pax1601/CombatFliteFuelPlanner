PREREQUISITE:
The planner will only work if the CombatFlite temporary folder is set to the default value (Documents\CombatFlite).
Moreover, the "Google Earth Link-up" option must be enabled in CombatFlite (should be on by default).

INSTRUCTIONS:
1) Start CombatFlite and the Fuel Planner;
2) Setup your flights, add waypoints, and select the loadouts;
3) Make sure that the Fuel Planner has loaded your edits. In the title bar of the Fuel Planner there is a counter
showing how many seconds have passed since the last update. The maxium time to wait is 60 seconds. If you want to speed
up the process, save the CombatFlite project as Autosave.cf in Documents\CombatFlite (this will trigger an immediate 
update);
4) In the Fuel Planner, select the flight that you wish to analyze from the top left dropdown menu;
5) Enter the desired stack reserve (default is 5500 lbs of fuel);
6) Make all the necessary adjustments;
7) The Fuel Planner generates a file in Documents\CombatFlite called Autosave_fuel.cf. Load this file to have the bingo
fuels automatically added to your waypoint names.

NOTES:
Pay attention to step 3. If you add a flight or change a loadout and immediately analyze it in the Fuel Planner, your
edits may have not been loaded yet. However it is not necessary to wait if you have only edited the waypoints (the loading
is immediate).

KNOWN ISSUES:
If you delete all the flights in CombatFlite, the last flight will still be visibile in the Fuel Planner, but selecting it
will have no effect. This is a limitation of CombatFlite.
